# Suits are denoted C, D, H, and S
# Values are denoted 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, A

# Straight flush: 5 cards of the same suit with consecutive values. 
# Ranked by the highest card in the hand.



 # if set(faces) has 5 elements then you either have a bunch of crap or a
 # straight. You can tell the difference by comparing the max/min of # the  set, which will give you the spread.

 # if set(faces) is two you either have 4 + 1 or 3 +2

 # if set(suits) is 1 you have a flush
