        # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
        # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
        # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
        # - Simple to use and understand for most users
        # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
        # # Overview
        # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
        # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
        # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
        # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
        # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
        # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
        # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
        # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
        # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
        # # Language mapping
        # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
        # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
        # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
        # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
        # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
        # # Other uses
        # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
        # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
        # consistent developer experience across different environments.
        # Example uses of this error model include:
        # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
        # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
        # errors.
        # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
        # have a `Status` message for error reporting.
        # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
        # `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
        # each error sub-response.
        # - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
        # results in its response, the status of those operations should be
        # represented directly using the `Status` message.
        # - Logging. If some API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could
        # be used directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

      # The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
      # programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
      # [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
      # - Simple to use and understand for most users
      # - Flexible enough to meet unexpected needs
      # # Overview
      # The `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message,
      # and error details. The error code should be an enum value of
      # google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if needed.  The
      # error message should be a developer-facing English message that helps
      # developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized user-facing
      # error message is needed, put the localized message in the error details or
      # localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain arbitrary
      # information about the error. There is a predefined set of error detail types
      # in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error conditions.
      # # Language mapping
      # The `Status` message is the logical representation of the error model, but it
      # is not necessarily the actual wire format. When the `Status` message is
      # exposed in different client libraries and different wire protocols, it can be
      # mapped differently. For example, it will likely be mapped to some exceptions
      # in Java, but more likely mapped to some error codes in C.
      # # Other uses
      # The error model and the `Status` message can be used in a variety of
      # environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
      # consistent developer experience across different environments.
      # Example uses of this error model include:
      # - Partial errors. If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,
      # it may embed the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial
      # errors.
      # - Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
      # have a `Status` message for error reporting.
      # - Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
      # `Status` message should be used directly inside batch response, one for
      # each error sub-response.
