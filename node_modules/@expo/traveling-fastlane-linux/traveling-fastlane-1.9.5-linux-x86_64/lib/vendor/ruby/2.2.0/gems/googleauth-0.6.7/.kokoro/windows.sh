# This file runs tests for merges, PRs, and nightlies.
# There are a few rules for what tests are run:
#  * PRs run all non-acceptance tests for every library.
#  * Merges run all non-acceptance tests for every library, and acceptance tests for all altered libraries.
#  * Nightlies run all acceptance tests for every library.
#  * Currently only runs tests on 2.5.1
